## Short descripton of the idea
A Django web-application that recognises flowers based on uploaded image and provides information on taking care of it. Besides, there are some basic knowledge about each species.

 - As a user I want to create an account and manage it
 - As a user I want to create my lists of plants (e.g. "Home", "Wish List"), as well as delete or alter them
 - As a user I want to mark favourites flowers (simultaneously adding them to 'Favourites' list)
 - As a user I want to upload photos
 - As a user I want to search flower's information by name
 - As a user I want to have my searching history
 - As a user I want to mark when I water my selected plant
 - As a user I want to get water reminders on e-mail with the time passed from the last one
