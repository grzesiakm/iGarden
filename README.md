 - As a user I want to create an account and manage it
 - As a user I want to create my lists of plants (e.g. "Home", "Wish List"), as well as delete or alter them
 - As a user I want to mark favourites flowers (simultaneously adding them to 'Favourites' list)
 - As a user I want to upload photos
 - As a user I want to search flower's information by name
 - As a user I want to have my searching history
 - As a user I want to mark when I water my selected plant
 - As a user I want to get water reminders on e-mail with the time passed from the last one
 - As a user I want suggestions about similar flowers based on photo I have provided or it's treatment
